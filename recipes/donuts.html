<h3>The <em>only</em> Donuts recipe you'll ever need</h3>

<p>This recipe consists of a two-day process resulting in the best Donuts you'll ever taste!</p>

<p>Approximate Donuts you will get: 24-30</p>

<h4>Ingredients:</h4>

<ul>
    <li>1kg All-Purpose Flour</li>
    <li>3 Eggs</li>
    <li>400g Whole Milk</li>
    <li>140g Sugar</li>
    <li>6g Salt</li>
    <li>110g Room-temperature Butter</li>
    <li>25g Fresh Yeast or 8g Dry Yeast</li>
</ul>

<h4>Classic glaze</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1kg Sugar</li>
    <li>100g Water</li>
</ul>

<h4>Chocolate ganache</h4>  
<ul>
    <li>500g Bittersweet Chocolate</li>
    <li>500g Cream</li>
</ul>

<h4>Recipe instructions</h4>

<ol>
    <li>Mix the sugar with the milk.</li>
    <li>In a bowl mix the flour, milk and yeast. After the yeast is dissolved add the salt and eggs.</li>
    <li>After your dough becomes one piece take it out of the bowl and mix the butter.</li>
    <li>If you're not using a mixer the dough might be really sticky at first but don't panic. I recommend using the Bertinet kneading method. Keep kneading until all the butter has fully integrated into the dough.</li>
    <li>Your dough should start looking like a soft ball at this point. Put it in a container/bowl and put a blanket on top of the container.</li>
    <li>Let the dough rest in the fridge for 24 hours.</li>
    <li>Next day your dough should be double the size it was yesterday!. Carefully take it out of the container(don't let the air inside of the dough out!).</li>
    <li>With your hands push the air to the sides of the dough. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a large circle.</li>
    <li>Using a Donut mold start cutting and putting the donuts in a place where they can rest for another hour at least. With the remaining dough you can make more donuts so don't throw it.</li>
    <li>After one hour your Donuts should be ready to jump into your preferred cooking oil (I use animal fat). The oil should be at 160Â°C.</li>
    <li>They're ready to eat now!</li>
</ol>

<ol>
    <p>Optional glaze/ganache</p>
    <li>Mix the sugar with the water. That's it you're done!</li>
    <li>Heat the cream and pour it on top of the chocolate. Mix and <em>voila!</em></li>
    <li>Now dip your delicious donuts, you earned it!</li>
</ol>
